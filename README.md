What is Andy X MSSQL Connector?
============

Andy X is an open-source distributed streaming platform designed to deliver the best performance possible for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, streaming between microservices and data integrations. Andy X Connect is an open source distributed platform for change data capture. Start it up, point it at your databases, and your apps can start responding to all of the inserts, updates, and deletes that other apps commit to your databases. Andy X Connect is durable and fast, so your apps can respond quickly and never miss an event, even when things go wrong.

<b>Andy X MSSQL Connector works only with version 3 or later of Andy X.</b>

## Get Started

Follow the [Getting Started](https://andyx.azurewebsites.net/) instructions how to run Andy X.

For local development and testing, you can run Andy X within a Docker container, for more info click [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/buildersoftdev)

After you run Andy X you will have to configure Andy X Connect. Configuring this adapter is quite easy only to json files need to be configured <b>dbengine_config.json</b> and <b>xnode_config.json</b>
> <b>dbengine_config.json</b> - SQL Connection Configuration file, it's the file where we specify tables which this adapter will check the changes and produce them.

> <b>xnode_config.json</b> - Andy X Configuration File, it's the file where we specify the connection with Andy X.

### Database Engine Configuration File
Below is an example of configuration file, this file should be saved into config directory of Andy X Connect before running this service.

	{
	  "Engines": [
	    {
	      "EngineType": "MSSQL",
	      "ConnectionString": "Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog={databaseName/master};Integrated Security=False;User Id=sa;Password=YourStrong!Passw0rd;MultipleActiveResultSets=True",
	      "Databases": [
	        {
	          "Name": "{databaseName}",
	          "Tables": [
	            {
	              "Name": "{tableName}",
	              "Insert": true,
	              "Update": true,
	              "Delete": true
	            },
	            {
	              "Name": "{tableName}",
	              "Insert": true,
	              "Update": true,
	              "Delete": false
	            }
	          ]
	        }
	      ]
	    }
	  ]
	}
EngineType accepts only MSSQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL for now

## Deploying Andy X Connect with docker-compose

Andy X Connect can be easily deployed on a docker container using docker-compose, for more info click [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/buildersoftdev/andyx-connect)

    version: '3.4'
    
    services:
        andyx-connect:
        container_name: andyx-connect
        image: buildersoftdev/andyx-connect:1.0.0-preview
    
        volumes:
            - ./dbengine_config.json:/app/config/dbengine_config.json
            - ./xnode_config.json:/app/config/xnode_config.json

Network configuration using docker-compose is not needed if only Andy X Connect is deployed. Network should be configured if this adapter will be deployed together with Andy X and Andy X Storage.

Below is an example of deploying Andy X, Andy X Storage, Andy X Connect and Microsoft SQL Server, if you have problems deploying Andy X via docker-compose please click [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/buildersoftdev/andyx).
